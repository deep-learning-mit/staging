Evaluating in-context learning and understanding why the behavior happens is both an interesting theoretical research question and a practical question that informs directions to conduct research that further advances LLM capabilities by, say, exploiting more of in-context learning.</p> <p>We attempt to explore the phenomenon of in-context learning by leveraging another exciting field of work on mechanistic interpretability where researchers set out to understand model behaviors by interpreting and editing internal weights in models. One such work that we base on is Representation Engineering by Zou et al. (2023)<d-cite key="zou2023representation"></d-cite> , where they construct a set of training text stimuli to probe LLM activations and use such stimuli to identify a direction that accurately predicts the underlying concept based on the neural activations of the model. This approach allows us to elicit readings of representation and control such representation.</p> <p>We propose to use methods in Zou et al. (2023) <d-cite key="zou2023representation"></d-cite> to evaluate in-context learning. There has not been previous attempts to examine the model internals holistically in a LLM while it is performing in-context learning. We expose such neural activations by constructing stimulus through artificial examples of in-context learning on binary classication tasks. We find a reading vector that shows high neural activity after the model is stimulated with the context pairs; such a “Context Vector” indicates the context the models draws from. While we hoped to find certain universal mechanisms across different datasets, we find that the Context Vector is dataset-specific and confirm previous hypotheses that in-context learning retrieves information from different parts of the model’s latent space.</p> <p>We then explore the results of controlling the activations along the “Context Vector” direction, in the hope that editing the activitions would further boost the performance on top of in-context learning. We compare the model outputs on the classification datasets in a zero-shot setting and a setting of natural in-context learning, with the “Context Vector” amplified, and suppressed. While we find boosting performance through such editing to be challenging and sometimes finicky to tune, we find the results to be promising on editing weights to suppress the context that the model draws from and drastically reducing the performance.</p> <h1 id="background--related-work">Background &amp; Related Work</h1> <h3 id="in-context-learning-icl">In-Context Learning (ICL)</h3> <p>An LLM is frequently aseked to perform a task in inference time that many realized providing some examples of how to answer the task can drastically improve the model’s performance. This phenomenon is called in-context learning. For example, Zhou et al. (2022) <d-cite key="zhou2022teaching"></d-cite> evaluates how LLM can become better at solving algorithmic problems through in-context learning, a task that LLM traditionally struggles at.</p> <p>In other scenarios, the LLM does not need to rely on prompts at all and can deduce the pattern from the few-shot examples alone to predict the answer. While there is no universal definition of in-context learning and its meaning has shifted over time, we define it as the performance boost to answer questions based on a limited amount of examples (as the context).</p> <p>Interesting, Min et al. (2022) <d-cite key="min2022rethinking"></d-cite> observes that such ICL phenonemon is observed as long as examples are given, and a mismatch between input and output pairs would not hinder the ability of models performing ICL and thus its performance on the tasks. Wei et al. (2023) <d-cite key="wei2023larger"></d-cite> further corrobates this work by finding on small models but show that as models scale, the ability to pick up on flipped patterns when given in-context examples with flipped labels and override semantic priors is stronger.</p> <h3 id="theories-on-why-icl-happens">Theories on why ICL happens</h3> <p>While the concept of ICL is well studied, the underlying mechanism of ICL is not well understood. Xie et al. (2022) <d-cite key="xie2022explanation"></d-cite> explains the phenomenon of ICL as an Implicit Bayesian Inference, where the in-context learning prompt serves as a stimulus for the model to go “locate” corresponding concept stored in the model’s latent space that the LM has learned implicitly during pre-training. They study this by generating a simple pretraining distribution that parameterizes the transition of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and another prompting distribution. In this setting, the authors reduce the ICL task to Bayesian inference to map the prompting distribution to the pretraining distribution.</p> <p>Akyürek et al. (2022) <d-cite key="akyürek2023learning"></d-cite> further explains that Transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly by encoding smaller models modularized to perform each specific tasks and update them based on the new in-context exampless. von Oswald et al. (2023) <d-cite key="vonoswald2023transformers"></d-cite>claims that Transformer-based in-context learners is similar to gradient-based meta-learning formulations where they found that the Transformer can learn smaller models of a certain concept by gradient descent in their forward pass.</p> <p>Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) <d-cite key="olsson2022context"></d-cite> draws parallel from ICL to a more understood phenomenon of Induction Head, where attention-only Transformers picks up on the algorithm to predict next tokens by searching for a previous occurance of the last token and copying the same next token from previous occurences. They claim that this can be a potential mechanism to explain ICL.</p> <p>While many hypotheses and theories have been proposed to explain ICL, most explorations to prove their theory has been small in scale, and the literature lacks a study on the large-scale LMs’ internals when performing ICL.</p> <h3 id="model-editing--representation-engineering">Model Editing &amp; Representation Engineering</h3> <p>We’ll use the Representation reading and controls methods presented in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01405.pdf">Zou et al. (2023)</a> to understand the context where the model attends to and discover directions that indicate such reasoning.</p> <p>Relatedly, there have been a recent surge in research related to model knowledge editing, including Meng et al. (2023) <d-cite key="meng2023massediting"></d-cite>, Zhong et al. (2023) <d-cite key="zhong2023mquake"></d-cite>, and Hernandez et al. (2023) <d-cite key="hernandez2023inspecting"></d-cite> that demonstrate different methods for locating and editing factual associations. Other work, including Shao et al. (2023) <d-cite key="shao2023gold"></d-cite> and Belrose et al. (2023) <d-cite key="belrose2023leace"></d-cite>, have shown results on erasing larger-scale memory units such as concepts. Li et al. (2023) <d-cite key="li2023inferencetime"></d-cite> applies such concept erasion techniques by conducting Inference Time Interference, where one can find a direction of causal influence on “truthfulness” data and increase the activations along that direction to increase truthfulness, scoring better on the TruthfulQA dataset.</p> <h1 id="experiment-setup">Experiment Setup</h1> <h3 id="datasets">Datasets</h3> <p>We adopt a total of 30 datasets on binary classification, (sentiment analysis, natural language inference, true/false inference) and multiple choices; 16 datasets are used by Min et al. (2022) <d-cite key="min2022rethinking"></d-cite>, plus 12 extra datasets in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tweet_eval</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ethos</code> dataset families, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rotten_tomatoes</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ade_corpus_v2-classification</code>. Following Min et al. (2022)<d-cite key="min2022rethinking"></d-cite>, we only use the test set to avoid potential cross-contamination with the data that the model is pretrained on. reserve <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">k=64</code> examples in the test for few-shot training, and the rest are used for testing.</p> <h3 id="training-data-generation">Training Data Generation</h3> <p>For training, we construct a set of context pairs for each dataset, each context pairs containing the same examples but different instructions. The instructions are “Pay attention to the following examples” and “Ignore the following examples” respectively, in the hope that by stimulating two opposites and examining the difference, we can find a Context Vector that represents what the model draws from. We then truncate the example at each and every token till the last 5 tokens, so we can get a neural activation reading for each of the tokens.</p> <p>A sample training data input using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rotten_tomatoes</code> dataset is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>[INST] Pay attention to the following examples: [/INST]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>offers that rare combination of entertainment and education.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>positive.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>a sentimental mess that never rings true .</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>negative.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[INST] Ignore the following examples: [/INST]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>offers that rare combination of entertainment and education.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>positive.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>a sentimental mess that never rings true .</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>negative.</p> </blockquote> <p>Each context pair is identical except for the instructions. We use the context pairs to stimulate the model to learn the context and use the context vector to control the model’s behavior.</p> <h3 id="testing-data-generation">Testing Data Generation</h3> <p>For testing data, we use 3 input-labels pairs as the prompt, with the first two pairs serving as the in-context examples, and the last pair serving as the question that we actually want to test on, obfuscating the label from the prompt.</p> <p>A sample testing data input using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rotten_tomatoes</code> dataset is as follows:</p> <p>Input:</p> <blockquote> <p>[INST] offers that rare combination of entertainment and education. [/INST]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>positive.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>[INST] a sentimental mess that never rings true . [/INST]</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>negative.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .</p> </blockquote> <p>Label:</p> <blockquote> <p>negative.</p> </blockquote> <h3 id="model">Model</h3> <p>We have explored using two models with 7 billion parameters, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Llama-2-7b-hf</code>; while we have found preliminary results consistent between the two models, all of our results later reported are from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0</code> for consistency and due to a constraint on computational power and time.</p> <h3 id="training-infrastructure">Training Infrastructure</h3> <p>We used the MIT Supercloud infrastructure and a local machine with a single RTX 4090 GPU to train the model.</p> <h1 id="results">Results</h1> <p>We present results first on finding the Context Vector in the embedding space, then on using the Context Vector to control model outputs and evaluate their performance.</p> <h3 id="representation-reading">Representation Reading</h3> <p>We use the Representation Reading method presented in Zou et al. (2023) <d-cite key="zou2023representation"></d-cite> to find the Context Vector. Specifically, we adopted the setup of the instruction response pairs where for a given function $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f</code>$ and pairs of instructions $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x_i</code>$ and $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y_i</code>$, we denote the model’s response truncated at the $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code>$-th token as $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(x_i)_j</code>$ and $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(y_i)_j</code>$ and take the neuron activity at the last token of each of the responses, namely the activations of each and every token in the response.</p> <p>We then perform PCA on the difference of the activations of the two instructions, namely $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">f(x_i)_j - f(y_i)_j</code>$ and find the first principal component $<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v</code>$ that maximizes the difference in the embedding space.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/correlation_tomato-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/correlation_tomato-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/correlation_tomato-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/correlation_tomato.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Graph plotting the correlation between the Context Vector sign and actual dataset label on Rotten Tomatoes dataset.

There are no clear patterns across dataset or between different layers of the Context Vectors, further indicating that in-context learning activates different parts of the model’s latent space with information about different types of tasks.</p> <p>We also conducted scans for neuron activities in the Context Vector across the different tokens of an example sequence in a similar style as Zou et al. (2023) <d-cite key="zou2023representation"></d-cite>, for which the previous work has referred to as Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) scans.</p> <p>The following are the LAT scans for the neuron activities corresponding to a Context Vector trained on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rotten_tomatoes</code> sentiment analysis dataset evaluated on different dataset sequences. The following graphs further corroborate the findings above on the dataset-specificity of in-context learning; while the a sequence from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rotton_tomatoes</code> dataset result in high neural activities for the Context Vector, most sequences from the other dataset do not, showing the uniqueness of such Context Vector. We have also observed most of the neuron activities in the later layers. This phenomenon makes sense since more abstract concepts and semantic structures formulate in later layers, thus being more correlated with the Context Vector, while earlier layers pick up more on token-level abstractions.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/lat_scan_rotten_tomatoes-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/lat_scan_rotten_tomatoes-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/lat_scan_rotten_tomatoes-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning/lat_scan_rotten_tomatoes.png" class="img-fluid" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> A LAT scan of the Context Vector trained on `rotten_tomatoes` dataset evaluated with a `rotten_tomatoes` sequence.

The test set has $16$ examples, each with one demonstration followed by a question. We evaluate correctness by having the LLM generate $10$ tokens and checking if the correct answer is contained in the output and the incorrect answer is not contained in the output, without being sensitive to case. This ensures correct evaluation so that an answer of no_entailment does not evaluate as correct for having entailment inside of it if entailment is the right answer.</p> <p>A hyperparameter which we denote $\alpha$ scales the size of $v$. If our Context Vector is $r$, sign value is $s$, then we have $v = \alpha \cdot r \cdot s$.

Even with our current results that demonstrate more success in suppressing the Context Vector than amplifying it, i.e. suppressing such behaviors than boosting it, this can have implications on works that try to perform model unlearning and impact the robustness of LLMs.</p> <h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2> <p>Through ablating with the random vector in the embedding space, it is unfortunate that controlling for the particular Context Vector we found is not particularly different from other vectors, despite it showing some promises on suppressing the results. We hope to run further ablation studies to confirm that suppressing the Context Vector is only suppressing the in-context learning behaviors of the specific behaviors and does not have other side effects.</p> <p>Regarding our current setup of the contrasting prompts of telling the model to pay attention or not pay attention to the concept, we can further explore the space of contrasting prompts. Directly related to our work, we would also like to explore the other type of experiment setup in Zou et al. (2023)<d-cite key="zou2023representation"></d-cite>; unlike the data pair setup where we ask the model to pay attention to the examples or ignore them, we can ask the model to “think hard about the context/structure of the question” and elicit neural activities that way.</p> <p>We are also interested in exploring vectors that control step-by-step reasoning and in general, intelligence. The phrases “Let’s think step by step” <d-cite key="kojima2023stepbystep"></d-cite> or “Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step” <d-cite key="yang2023deepbreath"></d-cite> are powerful phrases that elicit chain-of-thought reasoning and improve model performance. Could we engineer activation transformations that improve these models’ performance even more than and without the need for prompting?</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/staging/assets/bibliography/2023-11-08-representationengineering-incontextlearning.bib"></d-bibliography> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="iclr-blogposts/2023" issue-term="pathname" theme="github-light" crossorigin="anonymous" async> </script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
