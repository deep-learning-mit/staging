This exposes a significant limitation of models based on data: they can behave unpredictably when dealing with inputs that differ from the data they were trained on, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Machine learning models that are trained within a closed-world framework often mistakenly identify test samples from unfamiliar classes as belonging to one of the recognized categories with high confidence<d-cite key="scheirer2013"></d-cite>. This tendency of the model to make overconfident misclassifications is sometimes described in the literature as “arrogance.” This can be catastrophical when such models are deployed in the real world<d-cite key="amodei2016"></d-cite>. For instance, in self-driving technology, the system should warn the user and transfer the control to the human driver when it encounters unfamiliar scenes or objects that were not present in its training data, and thus it is unable to make a safe and reliable decision.</p> <p>Consequently, there has been a surge of research focused on improving DNN models to be able to assess their own uncertainty and recognize OOD inputs during their operational phase <d-cite key="yang2022"></d-cite>. Not only improving their usage in safety critical settings, being able to predict model uncertainty is important in predicting model performance. With increased ability to predict model performance, we can improve the training process and improve inference. In this project, we explore 3 different methods of quantifying uncertainty: Monte Carlo Dropout<d-cite key="gal2016"></d-cite>, Sketching Curvature for Efficient Out-of-Distribution Detection (SCOD)<d-cite key="sharma2021"></d-cite>, and Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian (SWAG)<d-cite key="maddox2019"></d-cite>. We’ll also attempt to modify these existing methods and even combine them in order to provide improvements to practicality such as RAM usage and improvements to important metrics we establish. We develop 2 methods, SCODv2 which is an extends a simple isotropic prior used by SCOD and SCWAG which combines elements of both SCOD and SWAG.</p> <h2 id="stochastic-weight-averaging-gaussian-swag">Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian (SWAG)</h2> <p>SWAG<d-cite key="maddox2019"></d-cite> is a method that can improve generalization in deep learning settings. It approximates the posterior distribution of weights as a normal distribution with mean determined by an average of weight iterates and covariance determined by the sum of the running variances of each weight and a low rank covariance matrix. More specifically, we use the following to perform our weight updates.</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">train_swag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">net</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">loader</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">num_epochs</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">K</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">25</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">swag_freq</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">50</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">swag_start</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">):</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The learned \(\bar{w} \in \mathbf{R}^d\) is the mean of the posterior distribution on weights. The \(\Sigma\) vector represents the running variance of the weights and can be diagonalized to get a very rough posterior. (The method we used to determine the running variance is unlike the one presented in the SWAG paper due to issues with numerical instability and catastrophic cancellation which resulted in negative variances. To address this issue we used Welford’s online algorithm.) The \(D\) matrix contains the last \(K\) deviations of updated \(w\) values from \(\bar{w}\) (including the effect that the updated \(w\) has on \(\bar{w}\)). This allows us to form a rank \(K\) approximation of the posterior covariance. Thus we have the posterior \(P(w\mid\mathcal{D}) = \mathcal{N}\left(\bar{w}, \frac{1}{2}\left(\text{diag}(\Sigma) + \frac{DD^T}{K-1} \right)\right)\). To sample from the posterior, we do the following reparametrization</p> \[z_d \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}_d)\] \[z_K \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{I}_K)\] \[\tilde{w} = \bar{w} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\text{diag}(\Sigma)^{\frac{1}{2}}z_d + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2(K-1)}}Dz_K\] <p>It is important to note that while a prior distribution on weights is not specified, it is implicitly chosen through how often we update our running average of the weights, variances, and deviations, as well as the optimizer being used.</p> <p>For the purposes of inference, each \(\tilde{w}\) determines the parameters for a clone model and with \(S\) samples we effectively have an ensemble of \(S\) models. Their output distributions are averaged arithmetically to yield the final output. We expect that for in-distribution inputs, the individual outputs do not disagree drastically. And for out-of-distribution inputs, the individual outputs can differ a lot. So like with out other ensemble method, a good metric of uncertainty here is to use the average-pairwise KL divergence between the distributions. Here are some results and findings of this metric applied to SWAG.</p> <p>We train a model with SWAG on the MINST and CIFAR10 datasets.

However, it is important to see that there are still images where our model has very low scores (high certainty).

So we retrained our models on all digits using SWAG and looked at the performance on a validation set.

Given a neural net with Dropout layers, and a new datapoint from test ID or OOD datasets, we output \(50\) different probabilistic distributions (rather than setting our model on evaluation mode, we keep the Dropout layers on), \(p_1, p_2, \ldots p_{50}\). Our uncertainty score is \(\text{Unc}(x) = \frac{1}{49\cdot 50}\sum_{i\neq j}D_\text{KL}(p_i\, \Vert \, p_j)\), i.e. the average KL divergence between any pair of distributions.

[Sharma et al.] explores this idea through a Bayesian framework. Let us assume a prior on the weights, \(P(w) = \mathcal{N}(0, \epsilon^2 I)\). By using a second-order approximation of the log-likelihood \(\log p(y,w\mid x)\), we arrive at the Laplace posterior \(P(w\mid\mathcal{D}) =\mathcal{N}(w^{MAP}, \Sigma^*)\), where \(\Sigma^* = \frac{1}{2}(H_L + \frac{1}{2\epsilon^2}I)^{-1}\) and \(H_L\) is the Hessian of the cross-entropy loss wrt \(w\). Given a pretrained DNN, \(\theta=f(x,w)\in\mathcal{R}^d\) where \(\theta\) determines a distribution on \(y\), we assume that the trained weights \(w^*\) are a good approximation for \(w^{MAP}\). We define our uncertainty metric to be the change in the output distribution, \(\theta\), when the weights are perturbed around \(w^*\) according to the posterior distribution. Using the KL divergence to measure distance between output distributions, we define</p> \[\text{Unc}(x) = \mathbb{E}_{dw\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma^*)}\left[ D_{\text{KL}}\left( p(\theta\mid x, w^*)\, \Vert \, p(\theta\mid x, w^* + dw)\right) \right]\] <p>We can approximate the local KL divergence using the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of \(y\) wrt \(\theta\): \(D_{\text{KL}} \approx d\theta^TF_\theta(\theta)d\theta + O(d\theta^3)\). Also, by change of variables, we can rewrite the FIM in terms of \(w\): \(F_w(x, w) = J^T_{f,w}F_\theta(f(x,w))J_{f, w}\) where \(J_{f,w}\) is the Jacobian of the network outputs with respect to the weights. Putting this together, we get that</p> \[\text{Unc}(x) = \mathbb{E}_{dw\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma^*)} \left[dw^TF_w(x,w^*)dw \right] = \text{Tr}\left( F_w(x,w^*)\Sigma^*\right)\] <p>We can also approximate \(\Sigma^* \approx \frac{1}{2}(MF_{w^*}^\mathcal{D} + \frac{1}{2\epsilon^2}I)^{-1}\), where \(F_{w^*}^\mathcal{D}\) is the averaged FIM on the training dataset<d-cite key="ritter2018"></d-cite> and \(M\) is the size of the training set. If the neural net has \(N\) weights, then the FIMs are \(N \times N\) matrices and computing them becomes intractable (both time complexity and memory).</p> <p>For simplicity, let us assume that the output of our DNN, \(\theta\), is the categorial distribution, i.e. \(\theta_i\) represents the probability assigned to class \(i\). In this case, we have that \(F_\theta(\theta) = \text{diag}(\theta)^{-1}\). Therefore, the FIM for one input os has rank at most \(\min(n, d)\) and we can represent it as \(F_w(x,w^*) = LL^T\), where \(L=J_{f,w}^T\text{diag}(\theta)^{-1/2}\). The same trick, however, doesn’t work for \(F_{w^*}^\mathcal{D}\) as it can reach rank as high as \(min(N, Md)\). For now, let us assume that we can find a low-rank approximation of \(F_{w^*}^\mathcal{D} = U\text{diag}(\lambda)U^T\), where \(U\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times k}\) and \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}^k\). With a few mathematical tricks (which can be followed in [Sharma et al.]), one can prove that</p> \[\text{Unc}(x) = \epsilon^2\Vert L\Vert_F^2 - \epsilon^2 \left \Vert \text{diag}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\lambda}{\lambda + 1/(2M\epsilon^2)}}\right)U^TL \right \Vert^2_F\] <p>[Sharma et al.] also provides an randomized algorithm for finding \(U\) and \(\Lambda\) by using the FixedRankSymmetricApproximation<d-cite key="tropp2017"></d-cite> algorithm presented in [Tropp et all.].

Rather than having a vanilla prior, we can generalize it to any normal distribution with diagonal covariance.

Then, our Laplacian posterior’s covariance matrix becomes \(\Sigma^* = \frac{1}{2}(MF_{w^*}^\mathcal{D} + \frac{1}{2}\Sigma^{-1})^{-1}\).

This method would not require matrix sketching of any form and lowers the required RAM necessary an SCOD can be quite RAM intensive. Using the \(\Sigma\) and \(D\) from SWAG to determine the posterior \(\Sigma^*\), we arrive the following measure of uncertainty (after digging through some math).</p> \[\text{Unc}(x) = \text{Tr}\left( F_w(x,w^*)\Sigma^*\right) = \frac{1}{2} \text{Tr}\left(F_w(x,\bar{w})\left(\text{diag}(\Sigma) + \frac{DD^T}{K-1} \right) \right)\] \[\text{Unc}(x) \propto ||L\Sigma||_F^2 + \frac{1}{K-1}||LD||_F^2\] <p>We do this by introducing a wrapper model that takes in a base model as well as the SWAG outputs in order to perform the Jacobian based operations during each forward pass. For evaluation, we look at the Spearman correlation of the uncertainty score with the target probability and we notice some improvement over SWAG on the CIFAR dataset.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_scwag_correlations-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_scwag_correlations-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_scwag_correlations-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_scwag_correlations.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> Spearman Correlation: -.9897 </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_scwag_correlations-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_scwag_correlations-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_scwag_correlations-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_scwag_correlations.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> Spearman Correlation: -.8484 </div> </div> <p>With MNIST, we already had near perfect correlation so this slight decrease isn’t too worrisome. However, the Spearman correlation has shot up drastically which shows that this method of combining the analytical approximation of uncertainty with an empirically constructed posterior has merit. There is something worrisome with the fact that the model with exactly \(bar{w}\) with its weights is producing distributions that have a maximum value of around \(.25\). We suspect we could have made some error here but have not been able to pinpoint anything wrong with out implementaton. The model still seems to have fairly accurate predictions as seen below.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_hard_scwag-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_hard_scwag-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_hard_scwag-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_hard_scwag.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_easy_scwag-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_easy_scwag-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_easy_scwag-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/mnist_easy_scwag.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_hard_scwag-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_hard_scwag-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_hard_scwag-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_hard_scwag.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_easy_scwag-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_easy_scwag-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_easy_scwag-1400.webp"/> <img src="/staging/assets/img/2023-12-12-uncertainty-detection-project/cifar_easy_scwag.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <h2 id="future-work">Future Work</h2> <p>For SCWAG, we could work on figuring out why our output distributions becomes less spiked as a result of using \(\bar{w}\) as the weights for the network. We suspect that it’s a result of starting our SWAG averaging for \(\bar{w}\) too early so we were considering \(w\) far away from flat local minima of the loss landscape. Additionally, we could inspect the arcing nature in the plot of target probabilities vs score. For near 0 scores, it seems that the target probabilities arc from .25 to 0 which is unusual. Finally, we want to think of a way to introduce the loss landscape more into our approach. Maybe we can form a more expressive posterior. If we can manage that, our uncertainty estimates and correlation might improve. But more importantly, we would be able to call our method SCALL(y)WAG which is pretty cool.</p> <p>In general and particularly for SCOD, we’d still like to experiment with priors that induce different types of posteriors. Because the dependence on prior is explicit here as opposed to implicit for SWAG, it allows us more room for experimentation in choosing nice expressive priors.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> </div> <d-bibliography src="/staging/assets/bibliography/2023-11-09-uncertainty.bib"></d-bibliography> <script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="iclr-blogposts/2023" issue-term="pathname" theme="github-light" crossorigin="anonymous" async> </script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> </body> </html>
