   abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.},

   abstract = {Training machine learning models in a meaningful order, from the easy samples to the hard ones, using curriculum learning can provide performance improvements over the standard training approach based on random data shuffling, without any additional computational costs. Curriculum learning strategies have been successfully employed in all areas of machine learning, in a wide range of tasks. However, the necessity of finding a way to rank the samples from easy to hard, as well as the right pacing function for introducing more difficult data can limit the usage of the curriculum approaches. In this survey, we show how these limits have been tackled in the literature, and we present different curriculum learning instantiations for various tasks in machine learning. We construct a multi-perspective taxonomy of curriculum learning approaches by hand, considering various classification criteria. We further build a hierarchical tree of curriculum learning methods using an agglomerative clustering algorithm, linking the discovered clusters with our taxonomy. At the end, we provide some interesting directions for future work.},

Eliminating discrete state variables provides computational benefits when using data-driven methods to learn the Koopman operator and its observables.

As a first result, we derive a formula that describes the prediction error of Koopman representations for an arbitrary number of time steps, and which shows that stability constraints can improve the predictive accuracy over long horizons.

Our analysis pinpoints how a noisy data collection pipeline can lead to a systematic mis-alignment between the resulting benchmark and the real-world task it serves as a proxy for.

   abstract = {Identifying coordinate transformations that make strongly nonlinear dynamics approximately linear has the potential to enable nonlinear prediction, estimation, and control using linear theory. The Koopman operator is a leading data-driven embedding, and its eigenfunctions provide intrinsic coordinates that globally linearize the dynamics. However, identifying and representing these eigenfunctions has proven challenging. This work leverages deep learning to discover representations of Koopman eigenfunctions from data. Our network is parsimonious and interpretable by construction, embedding the dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold. We identify nonlinear coordinates on which the dynamics are globally linear using a modified auto-encoder. We also generalize Koopman representations to include a ubiquitous class of systems with continuous spectra. Our framework parametrizes the continuous frequency using an auxiliary network, enabling a compact and efficient embedding, while connecting our models to decades of asymptotics. Thus, we benefit from the power of deep learning, while retaining the physical interpretability of Koopman embeddings. It is often advantageous to transform a strongly nonlinear system into a linear one in order to simplify its analysis for prediction and control. Here the authors combine dynamical systems with deep learning to identify these hard-to-find transformations.},

@article{Koopmanism,
   abstract = {A majority of methods from dynamical system analysis, especially those applied settings, rely on Poincaré's geometric picture that focuses on "dynamics of states." While this picture has fueled our field for a century, it has shown difficulties handling high-dimensional, ill-described, and uncertasystems, which are more and more common engineered systems design and analysis of "big data" measurements. This overview article presents an alternative framework for dynamical systems, based on the "dynamics of observables" picture. The central object is the Koopman operator: an infinite-dimensional, linear operator that is nonetheless capable of capturing the full nonlinear dynamics. The first goal of this paper is to make it clear how methods that appeared different papers and contexts all relate to each other through spectral properties of the Koopman operator. The second goal is to present these methods a concise manner an effort to make the framework accessible to researchers who would like to apply them, but also, expand and improve them. Finally, we aim to provide a road map through the literature where each of the topics was described detail. We describe three maconcepts: Koopman mode analysis, Koopman eigenquotients, and continuous indicators of ergodicity. For each concept, we provide a summary of theoretical concepts required to define and study them, numerical methods that have been developed for their analysis, and, when possible, applications that made use of them. The Koopman framework is showing potential for crossing over from academic and theoretical use to industrial practice. Therefore, the paper highlights its strengths applied and numerical contexts. Additionally, we point out areas where an additional research push is needed before the approach is adopted as an off-the-shelf framework for analysis and design. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

   abstract = {The complexity of robot dynamics often pertains to the hybrid nature of dynamics, where governing dynamic equations consist of heterogenous equations that are switched depending on the state of the system. Legged robots and manipulator robots experience contact-noncontact discrete transitions, causing switching of governing equations. Analysis of these robot systems have been a challenge due to the lack of a global, unified model that is amenable to analysis of the global behaviors. Composition operator theory has the potential to provide a global, unified representation of those heterogenous dynamical systems. It is expected that, if the theory is applicable, those fundamentally challenging robotics systems can be treated as linear dynamical systems in a lifted space. The current work addresses under which conditions a unified linear representation exists in a global sense for a class of heterogenous dynamical systems and how the theory can be applied to those robotics problems. First, a kernel representation of composition operators is obtained, and conditions required for converting the kernel representation to a linear state transition equation are established. This analysis results in an algorithm to convert a class of heterogenous systems including hybrid and switched systems directly to a global, unified linear model. Unlike prevalent data-driven methods and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, where results can vary depending on numerical data, the proposed method does not require numerical simulation of the original dynamics. The implication of the new method and its impact upon robotics are discussed. A few examples validate and demonstrate the method.},
