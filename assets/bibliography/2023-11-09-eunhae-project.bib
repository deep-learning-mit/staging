Recently, both computer vision and natural-language processing have witnessed great progress through the use of large-scale pretrained models. In this work, we present an empirical study of catastrophic forgetting in this pretraining paradigm. Our experiments indicate that large, pretrained ResNets and Transformers are signiﬁcantly more resistant to forgetting than randomly-initialized, trained-from-scratch models; this robustness systematically improves with scale of both model and pretraining dataset size. We take initial steps towards characterizing what aspect of model representations allows them to perform continual learning so well, ﬁnding that in the pretrained models, distinct class representations grow more orthogonal with scale. Our results suggest that, when possible, scale and a diverse pretraining dataset can be useful ingredients in mitigating catastrophic forgetting.},

Speciﬁcally, our contributions are: (i) a dual memory architecture emulating the complementary learning systems (hippocampus and the neocortex) in the human brain, (ii) memory consolidation via generative replay of past experiences, (iii) demonstrating advantages of generative replay and dual memories via experiments, and (iv) improved performance retention on challenging tasks even for low capacity models.

This ability, known as continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. In a general sense, continual learning is explicitly limited by catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance degradation of the old tasks. Beyond this, increasingly numerous advances have emerged in recent years that largely extend the understanding and application of continual learning. The growing and widespread interest in this direction demonstrates its realistic significance as well as complexity. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of continual learning, seeking to bridge the basic settings, theoretical foundations, representative methods, and practical applications. Based on existing theoretical and empirical results, we summarize the general objectives of continual learning as ensuring a proper stability-plasticity trade-off and an adequate intra/inter-task generalizability in the context of resource efficiency. Then we provide a state-of-the-art and elaborated taxonomy, extensively analyzing how representative strategies address continual learning, and how they are adapted to particular challenges in various applications. Through an in-depth discussion of promising directions, we believe that such a holistic perspective can greatly facilitate subsequent exploration in this field and beyond.},

A key challenge for lifelong learning is how to strike a balance between the preservation on old tasks and the adaptation to a new one within a given model. Approaches that combine both objectives in training have been explored in previous works. Yet the performance still suﬀers from considerable degradation in a long sequence of tasks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to lifelong learning, which tries to seek a better balance between preservation and adaptation via two techniques: Distillation and Retrospection. Speciﬁcally, the target model adapts to the new task by knowledge distillation from an intermediate expert, while the previous knowledge is more eﬀectively preserved by caching a small subset of data for old tasks. The combination of Distillation and Retrospection leads to a more gentle learning curve for the target model, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can bring consistent improvements on both old and new tasks4 .},

	abstract = {The mainstream paradigm behind continual learning has been to adapt the model parameters to non-stationary data distributions, where catastrophic forgetting is the central challenge. Typical methods rely on a rehearsal buffer or known task identity at test time to retrieve learned knowledge and address forgetting, while this work presents a new paradigm for continual learning that aims to train a more succinct memory system without accessing task identity at test time. Our method learns to dynamically prompt (L2P) a pre-trained model to learn tasks sequentially under different task transitions. In our proposed framework, prompts are small learnable parameters, which are maintained in a memory space. The objective is to optimize prompts to instruct the model prediction and explicitly manage task-invariant and task-speciﬁc knowledge while maintaining model plasticity. We conduct comprehensive experiments under popular image classiﬁcation benchmarks with different challenging continual learning settings, where L2P consistently outperforms prior state-ofthe-art methods. Surprisingly, L2P achieves competitive results against rehearsal-based methods even without a rehearsal buffer and is directly applicable to challenging taskagnostic continual learning.

	abstract = {State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a ﬁxed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efﬁcient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of ﬁne-grained object classiﬁcation. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset speciﬁc training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.

	abstract = {Unsupervised lifelong learning refers to the ability to learn over time while memorizing previous patterns without supervision. Although great progress has been made in this direction, existing work often assumes strong prior knowledge about the incoming data (e.g., knowing the class boundaries), which can be impossible to obtain in complex and unpredictable environments. In this paper, motivated by real-world scenarios, we propose a more practical problem setting called online self-supervised lifelong learning without prior knowledge. The proposed setting is challenging due to the non-iid and single-pass data, the absence of external supervision, and no prior knowledge. To address the challenges, we propose Self-Supervised ContrAstive Lifelong LEarning without Prior Knowledge (SCALE) which can extract and memorize representations on the ﬂy purely from the data continuum. SCALE is designed around three major components: a pseudo-supervised contrastive loss, a self-supervised forgetting loss, and an online memory update for uniform subset selection. All three components are designed to work collaboratively to maximize learning performance. We perform comprehensive experiments of SCALE under iid and four non-iid data streams. The results show that SCALE outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm in all settings with improvements up to 3.83\%, 2.77\% and 5.86\% in terms of kNN accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet datasets.

We conduct a systematic study analyzing the learned feature representations and show that unsupervised visual representations are surprisingly more robust to catastrophic forgetting, consistently achieve better performance, and generalize better to out-ofdistribution tasks than SCL. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that UCL achieves a smoother loss landscape through qualitative analysis of the learned representations and learns meaningful feature representations.

	abstract = {In continual learning (CL), an agent learns from a stream of tasks leveraging prior experience to transfer knowledge to future tasks. It is an ideal framework to decrease the amount of supervision in the existing learning algorithms. But for a successful knowledge transfer, the learner needs to remember how to perform previous tasks. One way to endow the learner the ability to perform tasks seen in the past is to store a small memory, dubbed episodic memory, that stores few examples from previous tasks and then to replay these examples when training for future tasks. In this work, we empirically analyze the effectiveness of a very small episodic memory in a CL setup where each training example is only seen once. Surprisingly, across four rather different supervised learning benchmarks adapted to CL, a very simple baseline, that jointly trains on both examples from the current task as well as examples stored in the episodic memory, significantly outperforms specifically designed CL approaches with and without episodic memory. Interestingly, we find that repetitive training on even tiny memories of past tasks does not harm generalization, on the contrary, it improves it, with gains between 7{\textbackslash}\% and 17{\textbackslash}\% when the memory is populated with a single example per class.},

	abstract = {Continual learning aims to improve the ability of modern learning systems to deal with non-stationary distributions, typically by attempting to learn a series of tasks sequentially. Prior art in the ﬁeld has largely considered supervised or reinforcement learning tasks, and often assumes full knowledge of task labels and boundaries. In this work, we propose an approach (CURL) to tackle a more general problem that we will refer to as unsupervised continual learning. The focus is on learning representations without any knowledge about task identity, and we explore scenarios when there are abrupt changes between tasks, smooth transitions from one task to another, or even when the data is shufﬂed. The proposed approach performs task inference directly within the model, is able to dynamically expand to capture new concepts over its lifetime, and incorporates additional rehearsal-based techniques to deal with catastrophic forgetting. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of CURL in an unsupervised learning setting with MNIST and Omniglot, where the lack of labels ensures no information is leaked about the task. Further, we demonstrate strong performance compared to prior art in an i.i.d setting, or when adapting the technique to supervised tasks such as incremental class learning.},

	abstract = {Lifelong or continual learning remains to be a challenge for artiﬁcial neural network, as it is required to be both stable for preservation of old knowledge and plastic for acquisition of new knowledge. It is common to see previous experience get overwritten, which leads to the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, especially in the scenario of class-incremental learning (Class-IL). Recently, many lifelong learning methods have been proposed to avoid catastrophic forgetting. However, models which learn without replay of the input data, would encounter another problem which has been ignored, and we refer to it as prior information loss (PIL). In training procedure of Class-IL, as the model has no knowledge about following tasks, it would only extract features necessary for tasks learned so far, whose information is insufﬁcient for joint classiﬁcation. In this paper, our empirical results on several image datasets show that PIL limits the performance of current state-of-the-art method for Class-IL, the orthogonal weights modiﬁcation (OWM) algorithm. Furthermore, we propose to combine self-supervised learning, which can provide effective representations without requiring labels, with Class-IL to partly get around this problem. Experiments show superiority of proposed method to OWM, as well as other strong baselines.},

	abstract = {In continual learning, a system must incrementally learn from a non-stationary data stream without catastrophic forgetting. Recently, multiple methods have been devised for incrementally learning classes on large-scale image classiﬁcation tasks, such as ImageNet. State-of-the-art continual learning methods use an initial supervised pre-training phase, in which the ﬁrst 10\% - 50\% of the classes in a dataset are used to learn representations in an ofﬂine manner before continual learning of new classes begins. We hypothesize that self-supervised pre-training could yield features that generalize better than supervised learning, especially when the number of samples used for pre-training is small. We test this hypothesis using the self-supervised MoCo-V2, Barlow Twins, and SwAV algorithms. On ImageNet, we ﬁnd that these methods outperform supervised pretraining considerably for online continual learning, and the gains are larger when fewer samples are available. Our ﬁndings are consistent across three online continual learning algorithms. Our best system achieves a 14.95\% relative increase in top-1 accuracy on class incremental ImageNet over the prior state of the art for online continual learning.},

	abstract = {Standard artiﬁcial neural networks suffer from the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, making continual or lifelong learning difﬁcult for machine learning. In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed for continual learning, but due to differences in evaluation protocols it is difﬁcult to directly compare their performance. To enable more structured comparisons, we describe three continual learning scenarios based on whether at test time task identity is provided and—in case it is not—whether it must be inferred. Any sequence of well-deﬁned tasks can be performed according to each scenario. Using the split and permuted MNIST task protocols, for each scenario we carry out an extensive comparison of recently proposed continual learning methods. We demonstrate substantial differences between the three scenarios in terms of difﬁculty and in terms of how efﬁcient different methods are. In particular, when task identity must be inferred (i.e., class incremental learning), we ﬁnd that regularization-based approaches (e.g., elastic weight consolidation) fail and that replaying representations of previous experiences seems required for solving this scenario.},

However, their efficacy is catastrophically reduced in a Continual Learning (CL) scenario where data is presented to the model sequentially. In this paper, we show that self-supervised loss functions can be seamlessly converted into distillation mechanisms for CL by adding a predictor network that maps the current state of the representations to their past state. This enables us to devise a framework for Continual self-supervised visual representation Learning that (i) significantly improves the quality of the learned representations, (ii) is compatible with several state-of-the-art self-supervised objectives, and (iii) needs little to no hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach empirically by training six popular self-supervised models in various CL settings. Code: github.com/DonkeyShot21/cassle.},

In this empirical evaluation, we evaluate various methods from the literature that tackle online continual learning. More specifically, we focus on the class-incremental setting in the context of image classification, where the learner must learn new classes incrementally from a stream of data. We compare these methods on the Split-CIFAR100 and Split-TinyImagenet benchmarks, and measure their average accuracy, forgetting, stability, and quality of the representations, to evaluate various aspects of the algorithm at the end but also during the whole training period. We find that most methods suffer from stability and underfitting issues. However, the learned representations are comparable to i.i.d. training under the same computational budget. No clear winner emerges from the results and basic experience replay, when properly tuned and implemented, is a very strong baseline.

	abstract = {In the online continual learning paradigm, agents must learn from a changing distribution while respecting memory and compute constraints. Experience Replay (ER), where a small subset of past data is stored and replayed alongside new data, has emerged as a simple and effective learning strategy. In this work, we focus on the change in representations of observed data that arises when previously unobserved classes appear in the incoming data stream, and new classes must be distinguished from previous ones. We shed new light on this question by showing that applying ER causes the newly added classes’ representations to overlap signiﬁcantly with the previous classes, leading to highly disruptive parameter updates. Based on this empirical analysis, we propose a new method which mitigates this issue by shielding the learned representations from drastic adaptation to accommodate new classes. We show that using an asymmetric update rule pushes new classes to adapt to the older ones (rather than the reverse), which is more effective especially at task boundaries, where much of the forgetting typically occurs. Empirical results show signiﬁcant gains over strong baselines on standard continual learning benchmarks 1.},

This is an unrealistic assumption for any real-world setting, which motivates us to propose: a practical real-time evaluation of continual learning, in which the stream does not wait for the model to complete training before revealing the next data for predictions. To do this, we evaluate current CL methods with respect to their computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments on CLOC, a large-scale dataset containing 39 million time-stamped images with geolocation labels. We show that a simple baseline outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods under this evaluation, questioning the applicability of existing methods in realistic settings. In addition, we explore various CL components commonly used in the literature, including memory sampling strategies and regularization approaches. We find that all considered methods fail to be competitive against our simple baseline. This surprisingly suggests that the majority of existing CL literature is tailored to a specific class of streams that is not practical. We hope that the evaluation we provide will be the first step towards a paradigm shift to consider the computational cost in the development of online continual learning methods.},

	abstract = {Continual learning is the problem of learning and retaining knowledge through time over multiple tasks and environments. Research has primarily focused on the incremental classification setting, where new tasks/classes are added at discrete time intervals. Such an “offline” setting does not evaluate the ability of agents to learn effectively and efficiently, since an agent can perform multiple learning epochs without any time limitation when a task is added. We argue that “online” continual learning, where data is a single continuous stream without task boundaries, enables evaluating both information retention and online learning efficacy. In online continual learning, each incoming small batch of data is first used for testing and then added to the training set, making the problem truly online. Trained models are later evaluated on historical data to assess information retention. We introduce a new benchmark for online continual visual learning that exhibits large scale and natural distribution shifts. Through a large-scale analysis, we identify critical and previously unobserved phenomena of gradient-based optimization in continual learning, and propose effective strategies for improving gradient-based online continual learning with real data.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06289},
	abstract = {Continual learning (CL) is widely regarded as crucial challenge for lifelong AI. However, existing CL benchmarks, e.g. Permuted-MNIST and Split-CIFAR, make use of artiﬁcial temporal variation and do not align with or generalize to the realworld. In this paper, we introduce CLEAR, the ﬁrst continual image classiﬁcation benchmark dataset with a natural temporal evolution of visual concepts in the real world that spans a decade (2004-2014). We build CLEAR from existing large-scale image collections (YFCC100M) through a novel and scalable low-cost approach to visio-linguistic dataset curation. Our pipeline makes use of pretrained vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) to interactively build labeled datasets, which are further validated with crowd-sourcing to remove errors and even inappropriate images (hidden in original YFCC100M). The major strength of CLEAR over prior CL benchmarks is the smooth temporal evolution of visual concepts with real-world imagery, including both high-quality labeled data along with abundant unlabeled samples per time period for continual semi-supervised learning. We ﬁnd that a simple unsupervised pre-training step can already boost state-of-the-art CL algorithms that only utilize fully-supervised data. Our analysis also reveals that mainstream CL evaluation protocols that train and test on iid data artiﬁcially inﬂate performance of CL system. To address this, we propose novel "streaming" protocols for CL that always test on the (near) future. Interestingly, streaming protocols (a) can simplify dataset curation since today’s testset can be repurposed for tomorrow’s trainset and (b) can produce more generalizable models with more accurate estimates of performance since all labeled data from each time-period is used for both training and testing (unlike classic iid train-test splits).

We propose our Learning without Forgetting method, which uses only new task data to train the network while preserving the original capabilities. Our method performs favorably compared to commonly used feature extraction and ﬁne-tuning adaption techniques and performs similarly to multitask learning that uses original task data we assume unavailable.
