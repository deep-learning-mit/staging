  abstract = {There has been significant recent progress in leveraging large-scale gene expression data to develop foundation models for single-cell transcriptomes such as Geneformer [1], scGPT [2], and scBERT [3]. These models infer gene functions and interrelations from the gene expression profiles of millions of cells, which requires extensive data curation and resource-intensive training. Here, we explore a much simpler alternative by leveraging ChatGPT embeddings of genes based on literature. Our proposal, GenePT, uses NCBI text descriptions of individual genes with GPT-3.5 to generate gene embeddings. From there, GenePT generates single-cell embeddings in two ways: (i) by averaging the gene embeddings, weighted by each gene's expression level; or (ii) by creating a sentence embedding for each cell, using gene names ordered by the expression level. Without the need for dataset curation and additional pretraining, GenePT is efficient and easy to use. On many downstream tasks used to evaluate recent single-cell foundation models \textemdash{} e.g., classifying gene properties and cell types \textemdash{} GenePT achieves comparable, and often better, performance than Geneformer and other methods. GenePT demonstrates that large language model embedding of literature is a simple and effective path for biological foundation models.},

Specifically, the combination of large-scale diverse datasets and pre-trained transformers has emerged as a promising approach for developing foundation models. While texts are made up of words, cells can be characterized by genes. This analogy inspires us to explore the potential of foundation models for cell and gene biology. By leveraging the exponentially growing single-cell sequencing data, we present the first attempt to construct a single-cell foundation model through generative pre-training on over 10 million cells. We demonstrate that the generative pre-trained transformer, scGPT, effectively captures meaningful biological insights into genes and cells. Furthermore, the model can be readily finetuned to achieve state-of-the-art performance across a variety of downstream tasks, including multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, cell-type annotation, genetic perturbation prediction, and gene network inference.

  abstract = {Single-cell-resolved systems biology methods, including omics- and imaging-based measurement modalities, generate a wealth of high-dimensional data characterizing the heterogeneity of cell populations. Representation learning methods are routinely used to analyze these complex, high-dimensional data by projecting them into lower-dimensional embeddings. This facilitates the interpretation and interrogation of the structures, dynamics, and regulation of cell heterogeneity. Reflecting their central role in analyzing diverse single-cell data types, a myriad of representation learning methods exist, with new approaches continually emerging. Here, we contrast general features of representation learning methods spanning statistical, manifold learning, and neural network approaches. We consider key steps involved in representation learning with single-cell data, including data pre-processing, hyperparameter optimization, downstream analysis, and biological validation. Interdependencies and contingencies linking these steps are also highlighted. This overview is intended to guide researchers in the selection, application, and optimization of representation learning strategies for current and future single-cell research applications., High-dimensional data generated by single-cell systems biology (omics) methods require powerful representation learning approaches to enable interpretation and interrogation of the structures, dynamics, and regulation of cell heterogeneity. In this perspective, Gunawan et~al. elucidate key steps involved in representation learning to guide optimized method application by researchers analyzing diverse single-cell data modalities.},

Here, we present a novel method to directly adapt these pretrained models to a biological context, specifically single-cell transcriptomics, by representing gene expression data as text. Our Cell2Sentence approach converts each cell's gene expression profile into a sequence of gene names ordered by expression level. We show that these gene sequences, which we term "cell sentences", can be used to fine-tune causal language models like GPT-2. Critically, we find that natural language pretraining boosts model performance on cell sentence tasks. When fine-tuned on cell sentences, GPT-2 generates biologically valid cells when prompted with a cell type. Conversely, it can also accurately predict cell type labels when prompted with cell sentences. This demonstrates that language models fine-tuned using Cell2Sentence can gain a biological understanding of single-cell data, while retaining their ability to generate text. Our approach provides a simple, adaptable framework to combine natural language and transcriptomics using existing models and libraries.

Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30\,million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

We developed a pretrained deep neural network-based model, single-cell bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (scBERT), to overcome the challenges. Following BERT's approach to pretraining and fine-tuning, scBERT attains a general understanding of gene\textendash gene interactions by being pretrained on huge amounts of unlabelled scRNA-seq data; it is then transferred to the cell type annotation task of unseen and user-specific scRNA-seq data for supervised fine-tuning. Extensive and rigorous benchmark studies validated the superior performance of scBERT on cell type annotation, novel cell type discovery, robustness to batch effects and model interpretability.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Rapidly generated scRNA-seq datasets enable us to understand cellular differences and the function of each individual cell at single-cell resolution. Cell-type classification, which aims at characterizing and labeling groups of cells according to their gene expression, is one of the most important steps for single-cell analysis. To facilitate the manual curation process, supervised learning methods have been used to automatically classify cells. Most of the existing supervised learning approaches only utilize annotated cells in the training step while ignoring the more abundant unannotated cells. In this article, we proposed scPretrain, a multi-task self-supervised learning approach that jointly considers annotated and unannotated cells for cell-type classification. scPretrain consists of a pre-training step and a fine-tuning step. In the pre-training step, scPretrain uses a multi-task learning framework to train a feature extraction encoder based on each dataset's pseudo-labels, where only unannotated cells are used. In the fine-tuning step, scPretrain fine-tunes this feature extraction encoder using the limited annotated cells in a new dataset.},
