                   single neuron - a puzzling phenomenon known as
                   'polysemanticity' which makes interpretability much more
                   challenging. This paper provides a toy model where
                   polysemanticity can be fully understood, arising as a result
                   of models storing additional sparse features in
                   ``superposition.'' We demonstrate the existence of a phase
                   change, a surprising connection to the geometry of uniform
                   polytopes, and evidence of a link to adversarial examples.
                   We also discuss potential implications for mechanistic
                   interpretability.",
